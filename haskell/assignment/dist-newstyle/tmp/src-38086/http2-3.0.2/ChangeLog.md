## 3.0.2

* Skip inserting entries that do not fit in the encoding table
  (#28)[https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/28]

## 3.0.1

* Including a necessary file for testing.

## 3.0.0

* DOS preventions.
* Providing Network.HTTP.Client.
* `Internal` modules are exported.
* Dropping the priority feature from Network.HTTP.Server.
* `Network.HTTP2.Priority` is deprecated.
* `Network.HTTP2` module is deprecated. Use `Network.HTTP2.Frame` instead.
* Adding some tokens.

## 2.0.6

* Dropping support of GHC 7.x

## 2.0.5

* Passing the correct request

## 2.0.4

* Freeing dynamic tables.

## 2.0.3

* Using shutdown instead of close in the example. This is important to
  send GOAWAY properly.

## 2.0.2

* Bug fix of flush limit.

## 2.0.1

* Bug fix for defaultReadN.
* Providing allocSimpleConfig and freeSimpleConfig.
* Deprecating makeSimpleConfig.

## 2.0.0

* Providing Network.HTTP.Server.

## 1.6.5

* Deny shrink of dynamic table to zero size
  [#17](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/17)

## 1.6.4

* checkFrameHeader for FrameHeaders.
  [#15](https://github.com/kazu-yamamoto/http2/pull/15)

## 1.6.3

* Fixing two bugs of HPACK pointed out by h2spec v2.

## 1.6.2

* Improving the performance of HPACK.
* Huffman encoding is now based on H2O's one.

## 1.6.1

* Improving the performance of HPACK.

## 1.6.0

* Reverse indices of HPACK are now based on tokens.
* New APIs: encodeTokenHeader and decodeTokenHeader.
* Deleted API: encodeHeaderBuffer -- use encodeTokenHeader instead.
* New module: Network.HPACK.Token

## 1.5.4

* Fixing a bug due to misuse of memcpy(). (#8)

## 1.5.3

* Adding debug information.

## 1.5.2

* Minor optimization for HPACK.

## 1.5.1

* Adding a missing file for testing.

## 1.5.0

* New API for HPACK. HPACK is much faster than 1.4.x (roughly x3.2).
  The default encoding is now Linear instead of LinearH.

## 1.4.5

* Removing zero reset from priority queues.

## 1.4.4

* Fixing a bug of reverse index.

## 1.4.3

* Priority benchmark is now external information versions.
* Using proper baseDeficit for deletion.

## 1.4.2

* Test files are now self-contained.

## 1.4.1

* The reverse indices for static and dynamic are combined for performance.

## 1.4.0

* Providing dequeueSTM, isEmpty and isEmptySTM. Users can compose
  their own control queue with dequeueSTM and isEmptySTM.

* Removing enqueueControl: it appeared that PriorityTree is not
  suitable for control frames. ã€€For example, the dependency of all
  control frames is stream 0.  So, PSQ does not contain multiple
  control frames at the same time.  We removed enqueueControl. Users
  should prepare a queue for control frames by themselves.

## 1.3.1

* Defining IllegalTableSizeUpdate.

## 1.3.0

* APIs `Network.HTTP2.Priority` are changed again. `Precedence` is introduced.

## 1.2.0

* APIs of `Network.HTTP2.Priority` are changed. `delete` is provided. Internal data structure is changed from random skew heap to priority search queue.
